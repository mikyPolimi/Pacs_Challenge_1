README is good.


Code:
  why instead of having a method called subtraction you didn't overload an operator-?
  why instead of having a method called sum you didn't overload an operator+?
  why instead of having a method called scalar_vector you didn't overload an operator*?

  why you have a #pragma directives around your code?

You didn't use getpot, nor muparser, nor json.
